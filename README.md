# Covi-Track
>A safety net to follow COVID-19

## About the project: 

In the COVID age, we require a system that keeps track of patient files, immunization data, and citywide health. Our project's objective is to build a network that, in a regulated setting, connects a hospital, immunization centers, vaccine manufacturers, and other related enterprises to an entire city. The city's people, its hospitals with staff and doctors, its immunization clinics, and its immunization providers may have their data managed by the ecosystem. Our goal is to present an approach that can be used to effectively manage the records of a city's citizens.


## Problem Statement:

Since 2020, the COVID-19 virus has wreaked havoc throughout the entire world. This caused a global health catastrophe. We experienced tremendous losses in terms of lost lives and income, and this crisis put the medical ecosystem to the test severely.


## Solution:


-Our ecosystem aims to build a network of cities that links a person to a hospital, a testing lab, a vaccination center, and a vaccine manufacturer. We have built an ecosystem in which we control the full vaccination program, monitor citizens' immunization records, conduct COVID-19 testing, admit patients for doctor consultations, and monitor their vital signs.
-Nine organizations, four enterprises, and 10 roles make up our system.
-This demonstrates the resiliency of our ecosystem. In order to combat COVID-19 in a more secure society, we want to provide a straightforward and user-friendly process.


The features of our application are as follows.
- Hospitals can track down people and learn about their medical histories

- Doctors and employees can book vaccination appointments for patients and verify their medical immunization status 

- Vaccination Centers can administer vaccines to individuals and hospital patients

- Vaccination Centers can request vaccines from Vaccine Manufacturers, who will then produce and supply the requested vaccines to the centers.
